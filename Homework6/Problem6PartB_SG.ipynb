    "As can be seen above, the probability distribution function is unable to differentiate between the two set of values for $\\tau$. In order to avoid having this degeneracy, we will have to select one of the two conditions, either $\\tau_i$ < $\\tau_{i+1}$, or $\\tau_i$ > $\\tau_{i+1}$,  for $i \\in$ len(D). However, we should take note of the fact that even though the order of these rates ($\\tau$) might be important biologically (i.e. one process has to occur in order for the second one to start), the order does not matter from a mathematical point of view (Commutative propoerty of multiplication).\n",
    "Hence, we specify that $\\tau_1 < \\tau_2 < \\tau_3 \\dots \\tau_n$ before doing model selection and parameter estimation."
