    "In [Homework 1](hw1.html), we plotted data of microtubule catastrophe times.  In this problem, we return to the data from the [Gardner, Zanic, et al. paper](../protected/papers/gardner_2011.pdf)  We will carefully analyze the data and make some conclusions about the processes underlying microtubule catastrophe.  You can download the data set [here](../protected/data/gardner_hw6.zip).\n",

    "In the file `gardner_mt_catastrophe_only_tubulin.csv`, we have observed catastrophe times of microtubules with different concentrations of tubulin.  So, our data set $D$ consists of a set of measurements of the amount of time to catastrophe; $D = \\{t_i\\}$.  To model microtuble catastrophe, we will assume that a series of $m$ processes must occur sequentially to trigger catastrophe.  This could be separate depolymerization events, binding of auxiliary proteins, etc.  We assume that each of these processes is a Poisson process, and that process $j$ occurs with rate $1/\\tau_j$.  Our goal here is to do model selection to determine the value of $m$.\n",
