# This first column has the concentration of fluorescent Sprire D that
# was used in all dissociation anisotropy experiments.  The second
# column has the concentration of monomeric actin that was titrated in
# both dissociation anisotropy experiments.  The last two columns
# contain the anisotropy measurements for each trial.
#
# These data were provided by Amy Rasson and Margot Quinlan.
