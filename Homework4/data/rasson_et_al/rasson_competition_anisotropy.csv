# This first column has the concentration of monomeric actin that was
# used in all competition anisotropy experiments.  The second column
# has the concentration of SDfluor, the fluorscently labeled Spire D
# domain, used in all competition anisotropy experiments.  The third
# column has the concentration of unlabled Spire D used in all of the
# titrations.  The last four columns contain the anisotropy
# measurements for each trial.

# These data were provided by Amy Rasson and Margot Quinlan at UCLA.
