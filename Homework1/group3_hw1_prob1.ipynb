    "Elena: My primary goals are to gain more/better intuition for the types of analyses that are most appropriate and informative for various types of data, as well to learn about alternative ways to graphically display data (vs. the usual bar graphs, etc... before the first class, I don't think I had heard of beeswarm plots before). Along the way, I hope to become more fluent in Python and refresh some of my knowledge of statistics. "

    "**Shashank:** The primary goal of taking the course is to learn the skill of representing biological dataset more descriptively. Even though I have had some experience in programming, the reason why I decided to take this course was that this class is about understanding your data and representing it in a way such that other people find it informative, and programming is being used as a tool, which would help me focus more on the statistical analysis."

    "**Michelle**: I am taking this class because my freshman year physics classed scared me away from python and I want to finally get over that fear and learn. I want to learn to think more critically about my data and to analyze it using something other than Excel and Matlab. Creating figures in Excel is horrible and makes me want to cry so I feel this class will help me learn how to represent my data in the cleanest way possible. "
